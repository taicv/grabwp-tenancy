No, this plugin provides multi-tenancy functionality without requiring WordPress multisite. It creates tenant isolation through domain-based routing and database prefixes.

= Can I use custom domains for tenants? =

Yes, you can configure custom domains for each tenant through the admin interface or by editing the tenant mapping file.
